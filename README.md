***I decided this was ugly af so i'm going to create another one with a different design. Since i was trying to learn tailwind and next.js i can say it was a nice experience.***

This project uses React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and an headles cms called [Hygraph(graphcms with the old name)](https://hygraph.com/)
